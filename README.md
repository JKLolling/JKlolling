### Howdy Folks ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack engineer with a special place in my heart for learning new technologies. While I specialize in JavaScript, React/Redux, Node.js and Python, my one true love is not any single language but rather the rush of making a cool product. Sometimes you'll catch me reinventing the wheel in my spare time, but that's just because I like to see how it works.

I especially love to work on projects that blend creative endeavors with technology. Check out this [SoundCloud Clone](https://sonic-fog.herokuapp.com/), where I contributed a waveform progress bar and a site-wide song player UI!


On the personal side of things, my interests are acting, music and the great outdoors. I have a BA in Theatre, which means I'm all about honest and empathetic communication - a skill that has served me well as a pair programmer, a team player and an evolving human.
